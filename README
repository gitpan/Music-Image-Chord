Music-Image-Chord version 0.01
==============================

Music::Image::Chord uses Imager to generate guitar chord tablature images,
representing something approximating a standard 5-fret chord image. Along with
the basic chord progressions ('c', 'Dm', 'g7'), you can construct your own
chords.

It displays the fingerings, open/closed strings and frettings, along with the
name of the chord. The test file doesn't generate text because it's impossible
to know in advance what fonts the client system has installed.

The module also gives you control over the basic display parameters, such as the
overall size of the image, fret sizes, optional crop marks, and width of the
frets. It currently draws in black-and-white, as that will probably be the most
common usage.

The test file attempts to generate a .png file, but by changing the extension
of the file it will generate any format that Imager is capable of.
